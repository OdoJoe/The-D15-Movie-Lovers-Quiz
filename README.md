# User Experience UX
- ## User Stories
- ### <u>First Time Visitor Goals</u>
* As a first time visitor I want to see a simple, uncluttered easy to use quiz game.
* I want the questions easy to read and clear how to select and submit the answer.
* I want to see my question scores and to know when the quiz has ended.

- ### <u>Returning Visitor Goals</u>
* As a returning visitor I may want to join the club and I want to see that line of navigation clearly displayed.
* The links to the clubs main page should be clear and open in a new tab should I want to continue with the quiz later.

- ### <u>Frequent User Goals</u>
* As a frequent user I want to see questions updated very regularly and have the quiz expanded to include more aspects of the club (include special quizes related to recent screenings with the club)


# Design
- ### <u>Colour Scheme</u> 
* The main page background colour is #2e2931 and the game title a lighter #B4BFB0
* The game screen div was coloured #246858 with a border colour of standard red.
* The buttons were coloured differently with a view to make them prominent against the background colours but also with an aim to make them seem part of the overall scheme. The idea of the colour scheme was to create the dimly lit greens and greys usually associated with a trip to an old cinema.
* The colour schemes were selected with the help of colormind.io and mycolor.space.

- ### <u>Typography</u> 
* Sans-serif and Arial are used throughout the site to keep in style with the D15 Movie Lovers Club (the hypothetical club created for my first portfolio project).

- ### <u>Imagery</u>
* No images were used in this site. However it is my plan to add image-based questions at a later date.

- ### <u>Wireframes</u>
- All Devices
    
- Desktop
    
- Tablet
   

- Mobile
   

- ### <u>Features</u>
* The quiz is displayed dynamically. The user experiences "page navigation" however in reality I am simply setting the style.visibility attribute of Divs to simulate page navigation.
* A variable number of questions contained in an array are used to drive the page.
* User input validation is achieved via event listeners.
* Naturally responsive design for a range of devices from Phones to tablets to desktops. The site is naturally responsive and didn't require media queries to force responsive design to different screen sizes.
* Nav buttons and link contain a Hover attribute.
* join us button changes colour when the cursor hovers.
